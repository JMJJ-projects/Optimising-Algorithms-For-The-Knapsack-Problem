## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This project provides a solution to the well-known **0/1 Knapsack Problem**. It leverages **dynamic programming** to efficiently compute the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack of fixed capacity. The knapsack problem is a common algorithmic problem used in various fields such as operations research, cryptography, and logistics. This implementation solves the problem optimally, making it useful for scenarios like resource allocation, budgeting, and planning. Comparing different types of programming to really learn and understand the use cases for algorithms.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

To use this project, simply clone this repository or download the source code and compile the C file:

### Minimum Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Write permissions in the directory, because a .csv file will be generated
- gcc to compile the .c file

### To compile the algorithm:
```bash
gcc knapsack.c -o knapsack
./knapsack
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing the project.
2. Generate a dataset using:
```bash
python3 generateData.py
```
3. Run the program using:
```bash
./knapsack
```
4. If you wish to try the program again with a new dataset make sure to rerun generateData.py

The program will then display the time taken by each algorithm to find the optimal solution
